# Test Instructions for R Library for ALTADATA API

First of all go to [altadata.io](altadata.io) and sign up. Then subscribe one of the free products. After that go to [dashboard](https://www.altadata.io/dashboard) and save your **api_key** because this key will be needed when using the library.

Example Data Product: [COVID-19 Worldwide Daily Data](https://www.altadata.io/product/covid-19-worldwide-daily-data-d3c974ec-9c7b-40b3-ac1b-5ddee9c94889)

You should check out the Dictionary part in the data tab of the data product page. Because we can only perform query operations with **filter option active columns**.

library(altadata)
```

Read the documentation online at the library's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/altabering/altadata-r) and work on data sets using the library
